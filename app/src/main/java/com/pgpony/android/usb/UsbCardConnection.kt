// UsbCardConnection.kt
// PGPony Android — USB Phase 2
//
// Enumeration, permission, and attach/detach for wired OpenPGP cards, plus
// the runner that executes a card operation over one.
//
// The NFC twin of this is OpenPgpCardReader, and the shapes deliberately
// match: hand in an operation that takes an OpenPgpCardSession, get a Result
// back on the main thread. OpenPgpCardSession depends only on the
// CardTransport interface, so nothing in the protocol layer knows which of
// these it is running on.
//
// WHERE THIS DIFFERS FROM NFC, and it is most of the file:
//
//   • NFC availability is two booleans read once. USB availability changes
//     while the app is open, because someone can plug a key in, so this
//     publishes changes rather than answering a question once.
//   • NFC needs no permission. USB needs a per-device grant, obtained through
//     a system dialog, delivered by broadcast.
//   • NFC reader mode is a modal session the platform drives. A USB
//     connection is opened and closed by us, per operation, which is simpler
//     but means the close is ours to get right.
//
// THREADING. bulkTransfer blocks. Nothing here may run on the main thread,
// which is why [UsbCardOperations.run] takes an executor and posts its result
// back rather than offering a blocking call that looks safe to call anywhere.
