// UsbCcidCardTransport.kt
// PGPony Android — USB Phase 1
//
// CardTransport over a USB CCID reader, the wired twin of
// IsoDepCardTransport. `CardTransport.kt` has said since HW Phase 0 that "a
// future USB-CCID transport would also implement this", and OpenPgpCardSession
// depends only on that interface, so nothing in the protocol layer changes.
//
// This file is deliberately thin. Everything that can go subtly wrong in CCID
// (sequence checking, time extensions, messages split across bulk reads) lives
// in CcidExchange behind the CcidPipe interface, where a test can reach it.
// What is left here is genuinely platform plumbing: find the interface, claim
// it, read the class descriptor, locate two endpoints.
//
// HOW THIS DIFFERS FROM NFC, which is most of the design:
//
//   • NFC is a short modal tap the platform drives. USB is a persistent
//     connection that can exist before the user asks for anything, and can be
//     unplugged mid-APDU.
//   • Android has no framework CCID stack, so the host builds the bulk
//     envelopes itself. IsoDep provides that layer for free.
//   • Removal is an explicit event rather than something to poll for, so there
//     is no awaitRemoval twin here. The NFC version exists because a tag left
//     in the field falls through to the platform dispatcher and launches
//     Yubico Authenticator (issue #7); unplugging a USB key cannot do that.
//
// PERMISSION. Nothing here requests it. UsbManager.openDevice returns null
// without a granted permission, and asking is a UI decision that belongs in
// Phase 2 alongside capability gating, not in the transport.
