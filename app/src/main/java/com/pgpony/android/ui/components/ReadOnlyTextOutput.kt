// ReadOnlyTextOutput.kt
// PGPony Android — 4.1.0, issue #10 (AraafRoyall)
//
// Renders a block of produced text — a decrypted message, an armored
// ciphertext — cheaply, and keeps a long one from being composed until the
// user asks for it.
//
// WHAT THIS REPLACES, AND WHY IT WAS SLOW
//
// Both output blocks used to be a read-only OutlinedTextField holding the
// whole string. OutlinedTextField wraps BasicTextField, which builds full
// EDITING state for its value: an annotated string, a text layout, and the
// selection and cursor machinery. `maxLines` clips what is drawn; it does not
// stop the value being laid out or held. So a long message paid the full cost
// on first composition, and paid again on every recomposition of the scrolling
// tab it lived in. That is the second half of issue #10 — the first half was a
// keyring walk on the main thread, fixed separately in the Decrypt tab's
// recipient detection.
//
// A plain Text has no editing machinery at all, so the same content costs a
// fraction of it. Wrapping it in SelectionContainer keeps the text
// selectable, which is the only thing an editable field was really buying —
// but only when the whole string is on screen. See the truncated branch below:
// selecting inside a preview would silently yield a partial copy.
//
// WHY THERE IS STILL A LIMIT
//
// Text is cheaper, not free: it still lays out everything it is given. So
// anything past [INLINE_PREVIEW_CHARS] is held back behind an explicit
// "open" action. That is the reporter's own design — a compact result, with
// the full body composed only when asked for — and it is the only version
// that stays fast as messages grow. PGPony already does this shape for
// messages with attachments (StructuredDecryptionResultScreen); this brings
// plain text in line with it.
